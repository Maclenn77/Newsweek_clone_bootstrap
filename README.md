## Building with Bootstrap - Newsweek

>This project consists of replicating the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>ðŸ’» website.
Newsweek is one of many site that uses Bootstrap for its design.

For this project, I have cloned Newsweek, a news site that has been builded with Bootstrap.

### Navbar

For Navbar, I used the Bootstrap class Navbar for creating quickly. Inside of the navbar, I added some flex class to order the items. Logo and buttons are positioned with flex end.

Navbar has the sticky-top class for keep visible all the time.

#### Toggler

Menu is collpased by the toggler option of Bootstrap. When it's large size, Menu is showed.
